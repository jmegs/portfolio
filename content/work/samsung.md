Samsung maintains a TV demo area in large electronics retailers – like Best Buy and Costco — across the country. Without a standardized model for the user’s experience, the system was hard for customers to understand and for Samsung to keep from breaking. Our team designed a simpler, more intuitive interaction model AND an architecture that Samsung could replicate and maintain at over 1,000 locations. The new experience doubled consumer understanding of product features while a maintaining 98% uptime rate.
