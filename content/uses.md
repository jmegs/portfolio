title: 'What I Use'

As a huge fan of tools, process, and self-education I always love when fellow internet humans [share](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) the whats, hows and whys of what the use to do their work. Here's me being the nerd I wish to see in the world.

## Design Tools

- I've been a full [Figma](https://figma.com) convert for the last couple of years. It's hard to go back to something non-collaborative and file based at this point. I use pages to separate iterations of work and use handy [emoji status icons]() to help other wayfind in my files.

## Dev Tools

- Editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Theme: usually [Monokai Pro](https://www.monokai.pro/) or [Github Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thenikso.github-plus-theme)
- Typeface: [Input Mono](http://input.fontbureau.com/)

- Terminal: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)

## Frameworks & Libraries

- For React projects I have [Next](https://github.com/jmegs/next-base) and [Gatsby](https://github.com/jmegs/gatsby-base) boilerplate projects.

- For static sites I'll use [static-starter](https://github.com/jmegs/static-starter), which is built around the [eleventy]() static site generator and [gulp]() for assets.
- To spin up new projects from these, I wrote the [tpl](https://github.com/jmegs/tpl) utility.

## Other Software

You can see the full list of apps I install on a new machine in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jmegs/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile).

- I waffle between Chrome and Safari depending on how paranoid I'm feeling.
- I use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) to back up files, but files are becoming more and more rare.
- I use [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) to manage windows on my desktop and it's hard to live on a Mac without it now.
- I subscribe to both [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) and [Apple Music](https://apple.com/music) and my preference changes a lot.

## Hardware

#### Computers

- Work: 2018 MBP, 2.7 GHz Core i7, 16 GB RAM
- Home: 2018 Mac Mini, 3.2 GHz Intel Core i7, 32 GB RAM

#### Displays

- Both: Apple Thunderbolt Display, still the best looking display out there for some reason.

#### Prehipherals

- Magic Keyboard 2 or a [Tada68](https://kbdfans.cn/products/tada68-mechanical-keyboard-gateron-swtich-65-layout-dye-sub-keycaps-cherry-profils) mechanical keyboard
- Magic Mouse because of gestures, not because of the inevitable carpal tunnel.
- Beoplay H7 headphones + Airpods
