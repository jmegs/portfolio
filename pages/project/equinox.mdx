Samsung maintains a TV demo area in large electronics retailers – like Best Buy and Costco — across the country. Without a standardized model for the user’s experience, the system was hard for customers to understand and for Samsung to keep from breaking.

The new experience doubled consumer understanding of product features while a maintaining 98% uptime rate.
