As a huge fan of tools, process, and self-education I always love when fellow internet humans share the whats, hows and whys of what the use to do their work. Here's me being the nerd I wish to see in the world.

## Design Tools

[Figma](https://figma.com)
: I've been a full convert for the last couple of years. It's hard to go back to something non-collaborative and file based at this point. I use pages to separate iterations of work and use handy [emoji status icons]() to help other wayfind in my files.

## Dev Tools

Editor
: [VS Code]()
: Theme: usually [Monokai Pro]() or [Github Plus]()
: Typeface: [Input Mono]()

Terminal ([View Config]())
: [Hyper]()

Tools and Frameworks
: For React projects I have [Next](https://github.com/jmegs/next-base) and [Gatsby](https://github.com/jmegs/gatsby-base) boilerplate projects
: For static sites I'll use [static-starter](https://github.com/jmegs/static-starter), which is built around the [eleventy]() static site generator and [gulp]() for assets
: To spin up new projects from these, I wrote the [tpl](https://github.com/jmegs/tpl) utility

## Other Software

You can see the full list of apps I install on a new machine in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jmegs/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile)

- I waffle between [Chrome]() and [Safari]() depending on how paranoid I'm feeling on that day
- I use [Dropbox]() to back up files, but files are becoming more and more rare these days
- I use [Moom]() to manage windows on my desktop
- I subscribe to both [Spotify]() and [Apple Music]() and my preference changes a lot

## Hardware

- Work: 2018 MBP 2.7 GHz Core i7 w/ 16 GB RAM
- Home: 2018 Mac Mini w/ 32 GB RAM
- Both: Apple Thunderbolt Display, still the best looking display out there. fight me.
