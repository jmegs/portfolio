Equinox personal trainers were using spreadsheets and personal text messages to manage their client business. Our team identified core trainer-client behaviors and built a progressive web app to manage schedules, build fitness programs, and set and track client goals.

It was important to understand the current state of the relationship between trainers and clients and how trainers were utilizing their current tools. We realized that a core part of their job is to understand their client's progress over time, but that there was no tool or official process to do so – creating tons of extra unpaid work for trainers.

The focus of the redesigned app was to give the trainer the right context at the right moment all from one place, so when the client walks in the door they can focus on the in-person relationship building, not have their heads down in several tools.
