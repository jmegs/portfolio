Samsung maintains a TV demo area in large electronics retailers – like Best Buy and Costco — across the country. Without a standardized model for the user’s experience, the system was hard for customers to understand and for Samsung to keep from breaking. Our team designed a simpler, more intuitive interaction model AND an architecture that Samsung could replicate and maintain at over 1,000 locations. The new experience doubled consumer understanding of product features while a maintaining 98% uptime rate.

The focal point of the experience is a wall of 5 TVs controlled by a central touchscreen. Rather than playing a continuous loop of content across all 5 tvs like the competition, our touch interface lets customers choose exactly which features they are interested in and which products to demonstrate them on.

Behind the scenes, we created an analytics and management dashboard that let Samsung see the real time status and performance of the experience for the first time. As well, marketers could schedule and deploy new promotional content across the whole from a web interface, rather than working with a vendor.
